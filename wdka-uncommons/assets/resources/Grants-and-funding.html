<h3>Grants & Funding</h3>

<p>
Artistic practice in the Netherlands is supported by a complex network of public funds, grants, and municipal programmes. While these resources can provide crucial support for projects, studios, research, and exhibitions, understanding how they work — and the conditions attached — is often a challenge for emerging artists and students. Funding systems reflect broader cultural and political priorities, shaping which types of projects are made visible, legitimised, and sustainable.
</p>

<p>
National funds such as the Mondriaan Fund and the Stimuleringsfonds (Creative Industries Fund NL) aim to support innovative, socially engaged, and experimental work. These institutions often set thematic priorities that influence how artistic value, impact, and relevance are defined within funding frameworks.
</p>

<p>
On a local level, initiatives like Fonds Kwadraat focus on Rotterdam-based practices, offering financial support, mentorship, and infrastructural resources for artists and collectives. The Gemeente Rotterdam also provides project-based cultural subsidies, along with application guides that help navigate administrative requirements.
</p>

<p>
Internationally, the Netherlands’ <em>International Cultural Policy 2025–2028</em> outlines strategic priorities such as cultural diplomacy, sustainability, and inclusion. These policy frameworks shape how funding is distributed and which forms of artistic practice are encouraged or made viable.
