<h3>Piracy & Shadow Libraries</h3>

<p>
Shadow libraries emerge from unequal access to knowledge. Academic texts, theory, and artistic research are often locked behind paywalls, institutional logins, or expensive publishing systems that exclude those without formal affiliations or financial means. Shadow libraries respond to this condition by creating informal, decentralised infrastructures for sharing texts, media, and research outside official channels.
</p>

<p>
Rather than functioning as neutral archives, shadow libraries operate as political tools. Platforms such as UbuWeb demonstrate how piracy can act as cultural preservation: collecting and hosting avant-garde films, sound works, poetry, and theoretical texts that would otherwise disappear due to copyright restrictions or market disinterest. Similarly, projects like Project Gutenberg work within legal limits by distributing public-domain texts freely, while larger aggregators such as Anna’s Archive operate in a legal grey zone, prioritising access and preservation over compliance.
</p>

<p>
Shadow libraries are not only about downloading texts, but also about collective learning and alternative pedagogies. As discussed in <em>Learning from Friends: The Collective School</em>, knowledge circulates through peer networks, shared reading lists, and informal study groups rather than top-down institutional structures. These practices challenge the assumption that education must be mediated by universities, publishers, or profit-driven platforms.
</p>

<p>
For many artists and students, shadow libraries remain essential infrastructures for self-education, research, and intellectual autonomy — making visible the structural barriers that render piracy necessary in the first place.
