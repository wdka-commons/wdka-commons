<h3>Materials & Circularity</h3>

<p>
Working with materials as an art student often means navigating high costs, limited access, and a constant pressure to buy new. At the same time, cities like Rotterdam are overflowing with surplus, waste, and leftover materials from industry, construction, institutions, and everyday life. Circular initiatives operate precisely in this gap, redistributing materials, knowledge, and skills while questioning extractive and consumer-driven modes of production.
</p>

<p>
Spaces such as SCRAP give industrial residual materials a second life by making them affordable and accessible to artists, designers, and makers. Similarly, initiatives like MooiZooi or Buurman focus on rescued or refurbished materials (wood, tools, and creative supplies) while also offering workshops that reconnect material use with craftsmanship and care. These spaces do not only provide materials; they also foster learning through doing and sharing.
</p>

<p>
On a more informal and community-based level, weggeefwinkels, neighbourhood WhatsApp groups, and platforms like circu_watte rely on trust, generosity, and mutual aid. They make visible how much usable material circulates locally, and how redistribution can happen without money changing hands. Within WdKA itself, the Material Rescue Community and the Trash Bunker operate as internal ecosystems of exchange, reducing waste while strengthening connections between students.
</p>

<p>
Circularity here is not just an environmental strategy, but a social and political one: it resists overproduction, challenges institutional scarcity, and proposes alternative ways of sustaining artistic practice through reuse, repair, and collective responsibility.
